                <h2>AI School Project</h2>
                <p>This project involved creating an AI-powered racecar using the NEAT (NeuroEvolution of Augmenting Topologies) algorithm. The car was designed to autonomously navigate a racecourse, adjusting its behavior based on real-time sensor input, optimizing its driving strategy through evolutionary techniques. The goal was to demonstrate the power of AI in solving complex, dynamic challenges, such as autonomous driving.</p>

                <img src="https://placehold.co/250x250" alt="Website Project">
                <h2>Personal Website</h2>
                <p>This portfolio website showcases my skills, projects, and achievements. I developed it using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and utilized Docker to containerize the entire application for easy deployment and scalability. The website is designed to be both a personal project and a demonstration of my web development skills, with a clean and responsive design that adapts to various screen sizes and devices.</p>

            <!-- Project 3: Home Server Setup -->
            <div class="project-box">
                <img src="https://placehold.co/250x250" alt="Server Project">
                <h2>Home Server Setup</h2>
                <p>For this project, I built and configured a home server capable of hosting a wide range of applications for both personal and public use. The server serves as a test environment for various projects, including website hosting, file sharing, and other web services. I managed the server using Proxmox and Docker for containerization, ensuring high reliability, scalability, and security for all hosted applications. This project provided me with hands-on experience in server management, virtualization, and network configuration.</p>
